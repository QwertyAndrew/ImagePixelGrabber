# ImagePixelGrabberRBLX!
A small Python software where it helps user to resize a PNG image to 64x64 resolution, along an export of RGB/RGBA array inside a new text file ColorValue.txt. 

This is purposely for a [Roblox game](https://www.roblox.com/games/11442061911/image-png) where you can upload any images in 64x64 resolution without being check by the moderation bot. 

Note that you cannot do anything in this game except see your given image displaying as 64 x 64 resolution, this is for education purposes, therefore any images you send, never be saved at all, nor be shown in public.

# Installation
You need Python, so make sure to [download Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/) first.
After that, you need to install Pillow, therefore you need to type this inside the terminal.
```python
pip install Pillow
```
Once installed, you are ready to go.

# Usage
1. Implement a PNG, JPG, or JPEG file inside the folder.

2. Open the Python file.
3. As long as it's a valid file format, the image itself will be resized to 64x64 resolution. It will also open the file just to let you know how it will looks like.

4. Wait until the console prints "Success", there will be a new file called ColorValue.txt, contains an array of color value from the resized image.

5. To implement the color value to the game, create a new [Pastebin](https://pastebin.com), paste the color array inside.

![](/ImageForREADME/Pastebin.jpg)

6. Remember to set it public, and upload to Pastebin.
7. Copy the ID of your Pastebin, you can even use the example ID below.

![](/ImageForREADME/PastebinID.jpg)

8. Simply paste the ID to the texbox in the game.
9. Your image is now in the game.
